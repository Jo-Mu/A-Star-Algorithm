# A-Star-Algorithm
A console Implementation of the A* Algorithm in C++. The algorithm will find the shortest path between 2 points on a map.

User can choose from a map with a diagonal path or a map with a normal (plus) path.

User has the option to change the position of the start and end points or toggle on/off points as obstacles to change the predicted path.
